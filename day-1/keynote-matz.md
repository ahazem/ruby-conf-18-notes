#### About the speaker (extracted from RubyConf website)

This feels a little bit silly to actually do, but here you go:

> "The creator of Ruby, Matz works for Heroku and the Ruby Assocation to improve everything Ruby."

#### Intro

The talk is about the power of the community. Matz get on stage.

#### Notes

Matz talks about reading about pascal in a book, and how he got interested in programming languages. How human mind can be expressed:

> "A programming language is a form of expressing our ideas."

He talks about different programming languages, and how they are designed by intention to do specific tasks.

Recalls how he decided to create a prgoramming language, feeling he got the necessary skills to implement a programming language like others do.

At first, the total number of the language users were only one person, himself.

He kept developing Ruby for 2 years between 1993 and 1995. By that time, the community grow up to almost 200 people.

Talks about how `Thomas Dave` of `The Pragmatic Programmer` (and also later, `The Pragmatic Bookshelf`) spoke to him in 2000 to write a book about Ruby in English.

The number of attendees in the very first ruby conference were: 34!

Estimated no. of users nowadays: +1M.

Talking about how the community is open and virtual, but allows everybody to participate:

> "You, he and everyone is part of that community."

Such a community has no membership, the community is inclusive:

> "Ruby heavily relies on the community, without the community Ruby wouldn't be Ruby."

To him, the community is like a Typhoon. He explains how so.

He proceeds to talk about how he is sick of claims like Ruby is dead, and how languages or technologies get past the hype peak:

> "If Ruby is in a trough now, it's the best time to invest!"

> "Ruby's policy is never to give up."

He talks about new features in upcoming Ruby releases.

2.6 is coming this Christmas.
3.0 is next year.
