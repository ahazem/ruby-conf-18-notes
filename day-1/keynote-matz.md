#### About the speaker (extracted from RubyConf website)

This feels a little bit silly to actually do, but here you go:

> "The creator of Ruby, Matz works for Heroku and the Ruby Assocation to improve everything Ruby."

#### Intro

The talk is about the power of the community. Matz gets on stage.

Jokes about feeling 30% less intelligent speaking in English. Laughter.

#### Notes

Matz talks about reading about Pascal in a book, and how he got interested in programming languages. How human mind can be expressed:

> "A programming language is a form of expressing our ideas."

He talks about different programming languages, and how they are designed by intention to do specific tasks.

Recalls how he decided to create a programming language, feeling he got the necessary skills to implement a programming language like others do.

At first, the total number of the language users were only one person, himself.

He kept developing Ruby for 2 years between 1993 and 1995. By that time, the community grow up to almost 200 people.

Talks about how `Thomas Dave` of `The Pragmatic Programmer` (and also later, `The Pragmatic Bookshelf`) spoke to him in 2000 to write a book about Ruby in English.

The number of attendees in the very first ruby conference were: 34!

Estimated no. of users nowadays: +1 Million.

Talking about how the community is open and virtual, but allows everybody to participate:

> "You, he and everyone is part of that community."

Such a community has no membership, the community is inclusive:

> "Ruby heavily relies on the community, without the community Ruby wouldn't be Ruby."

To him, the community is like a Typhoon. He explains how so.

> "The typhoon's main structure is like wind and rain and cloud and something like that, and we cannot touch or move or even delete the typhoon. the structure comes with a very huge power. Okay, the Ruby community is kind of like that. We see, so you are part of the Ruby community, but then you cannot be representative of the Ruby community. You are part of the Ruby community. I am often considered the leader of the Ruby community. Actually, I am not. I am just a part of the Ruby community."

Tells a little ancedote from the very beginning of the Ruby mailing list:

> "I remember. I told you about the forming of the mailing list back in 1995, and the first mail in the mailing list was from my friend. Congrats on forming the mailing list."

Laughter.

> "A good friend, I thought. Okay. The second mail, by the way I cannot compile your Ruby program."

Laughter.

> "The third mail was from me. Okay, I fixed it. Thank you."

Laughter.

> "And the fourth mail is okay, I found another bug."

Laughter.

> "Then I fixed it, and continued like that: report, fix it. That is the key. Okay, we got tons of bug reports in the history of Ruby. Actually, I don't consider myself a genius programmer, but you know, I think I am very good at designing a language. I don't consider myself as a great programmer, I created many bugs. And in the past we got so many requests and proposals from the community. Discussions about the type system and the compiler and all the support. These are from the community, it is not from me. So I get proposals. I consider it a lot, and I make a final decision. But still, I was not the one who invented or who came up with those ideas. And I am not really good as a documentation writer. Many people contribute by making Ruby documentation better, and they form the meet-ups, they write the book books, they organize the conferences, so we owe much to the community."

He proceeds to talk about how he is sick of claims like Ruby is dead, and how languages or technologies get past the hype peak:

> "If Ruby is in a trough now, it's the best time to invest!"

Continues talking about the community. Proposes everyone in the hall shake hands. Everyone does.

#### Q&A

I wasn't paying attention to questions and answers on the first day.
