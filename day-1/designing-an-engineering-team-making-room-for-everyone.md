### About the speaker (extracted from RubyConf website)

Jack Danger is a linguist, an engineering leader, and a prolific open source contributor. He has commits in Ruby core, in Rails core, and he's managed multiple teams that own and operate massive Rails applications. Gusto is his 7th startup.

### Intro

He briefly introduces himself.

Jokes about having a lingusitcs degree (and being terrible at career planning). Laughter.

The talk is about interviewing, how there's no-one-size-fits-all when it comes to hiring, and scaling teams.

### Notes

Discusses the usual answer to how to design an engineering team: hiring great engineers!

> "This idea of how you could simply hire great engineers to build/scale your team is wrong. In fact, super terrible!"

> "Especially the idea there's a great or real engineer out there. This is the core problem."

> "The phrase great engineer itself is so coarse: it obfuscates all the skills an engineer can have!"

Talks about how big software engineering is as a field, and how most engineers are only comptent in a handful of skills.

Gives an example about two candidates with different backgrounds and skill sets.

Asks: which one would be more senior? Which one would pass the other interview's bar?

Talks about how engineering teams lose on a lot of talent by saying things like:

- "At this company, we have a high bar"
- "We cannot lower our hiring bar for some candidates"

There are two lies when it comes to that idea:

Talks how he would prefer a candidate with a proven growth trajectory:

> “If a candiate can solve a complex problem during an interivew, that shows they are able to learn and develop. I want to hire for that. It doesn’t matter where a candidate is, what matters is where they can get to”.

Shows a huge graph about all the skills involved in Rails.

Zooms in. Gives a few examples about different topics/skills you can have or haven't.

Obviously it is not feasible that someone would have all of them.

Continues talking about how to match up the skills between a company and a candidate.

Gets into a different but related topic.

> "There are two industries that are well ahead of software engineering and we can learn from their mistakes."

Aviation and Medicine.

Talks about fatalities in aviation, and how it dropped significantly in the last 100 years between the time commerical flights were introduced and now.

How so? He explains, they just had to figure out:

> "What are the things required to keep a plane up in the air?"

Gets into medicine.

Talks about things we can copy from them:

> "The ability to play different roles, and teaching hospitals."

Explains what roles docters/nurses play in an operation room.

Jokes about how a team of developers would be like in an operating room. Laughter.

![Let's rewrite this patient in React](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dr6FBRLU0AAwHEW.jpg)

Talks about his thoughts on technical leadership, and traits of successful engineering teams.

> "All these teams had students, people in learning positions."

As an example, talks about teaching hospitals and how they out-perform non-teaching hospitals.

Tells a story from his time at Square about skills he had in 2011 that are no longer relevant today.

Reviews the points he talked about.

Puts in some final thoughts.

> "Let's hire people and develop them, based on the actual skills that our companies need."

Talk ends.
