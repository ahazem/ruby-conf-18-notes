#### About the speaker (extracted from RubyConf website)

Jack Danger is a linguist, an engineering leader, and a prolific open source contributor. He has commits in Ruby core, in Rails core, and he's managed multiple teams that own and operate massive Rails applications. Gusto is his 7th startup.

### Intro

He briefly introduces himself.

Jokes about having a lingusitcs degree (and being terrible at career planning). Laughter.

The talk is about interviewing, how there's no-one-size-fits-all when it comes to hiring, and scaling teams.

### Notes

> "This idea of how you could simply hire great engineers to build/scale your team is wrong. In fact, super terrible!"

> "Especially the idea there's a great or real engineer out there. This is the core problem."

> "The phrase great engineer itself is so coarse: it obfuscates all the skills an engineer can have!"

Talks about how big is software engineering as a field, and how most engineers are only comptent in a few of them.

Gives an example about two candidates with different backgrounds and skill sets.

Asks: which one would be more senior? Which one would pass the other interview's bar?

Talks about how engineering teams lose on a lot of talent by saying things like:

- "At this company, we have a high bar"
- "We cannot lower our hiring bar for some candidates"

There are two lies when it comes to that idea:

> “It doesn’t matter where a candidate is, what matters is where they can get to”.

Shows a huge graph about all the skills involved in Rails.

Zooms in. Gives a few examples about different topics/skills you can have or haven't.

Obviously it is not feasible that someone would have all of them.



You have no real way to evaluate everybody.

Two industries ahead of software engineering in how secure and good they’re doing there jobs:

Aviation and Medicine

What do you need to do to keep a plane up in the air?

Gets into medicine, talks about various things how things go in an operating room

### Q&A:

Haven't paid attention to writing questions and answers until the second day.
