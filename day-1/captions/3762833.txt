Please stand by for real time captions.

>>> Good morning! Good morning, RubyConf. How are we doing?  All right, so as you all come in, or maybe actually as you are seated. As you come in, we don't have a lot of extra chairs, so if you see a chair in the middle, if you raise a hand or if you slide in, whichever is going to be easier. The police, if people are coming in, let -- open seats. -- But please, if people are coming in, open seats. They are beckoning you to come sit next to them. Please, sit next to me! It's okay if you're not going to sit with your buddy because you will have plenty of opportunities for that around the conference. Do I have a little bit of a -- the podium once my laptop to slide off, which is not the greatest feeling. [ Laughter ] to have. So first of all, I want to thank Beth Harbert. She was playing piano for us over there, so thank you, Beth, for treating us to that. We still have got open seats. As you come in, people raise their hands where seats are. This is a really, real -- really cool place for someone who is ever been to L.A. for Rubicon -- RubyConf. We have been in a lot of cities over the years. This is number 19 .  This is RubyConf 19 , just for those of you who started at the one in Tampa Bay. Yeah, so the Biltmore is very cool. This is probably the coolest venue we've ever been here. I'm sorry, I don't have any slides with slime or Ghostbusters stuff. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> All right, let's get to business. So first important slide here, Wi-Fi. You probably have Artie figured out. If you have not, that is the information. We have told after 20 minutes of -- already figured out. If you have not, that is the information. We have told after 20 minutes of inactivity it's going to cut you off, so just If you have not, that is the information. We have told after 20 minutes of inactivity it's going to cut you off, so just  be aware of that. Like I do not know, browse the Internet or something. Just FYI, so kind of a challenge for you. So, offering a purple shirt. There is staff in the back. I would walk around except I'm worried my laptop is going to slide off, so I will stay right here. So questions, concerns, anything? Back folks in the shirt can help you out. We can get an answer for you. If they don't know, they will find someone who does. All right, on-demand trivia. Okay, so we have childcare. Did I miss a slide? No, I did not. Childcare. We have childcare. We usually have children. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> All the stuff we planned well in advance, and we do this -- we've done this several years now, and usually we have kids in our childcare room, and this time we do not. They said please, please! We will look after your pets. They are [ Indiscernible ] which is the main level where the sponsor Galleria is. There is a stairwell going up, that is where you will find that. You will also find a lactation room, gender-neutral bathrooms there, so maybe if you have a pet here that is lowly -- lonely, you don't want to leave it in the room, there you go. Also, this year we have pronoun buttons, so that is cool. You can get that and put it on your lanyard. I recommend I saw people were putting it on their shirts yesterday. Do not do that because you will ruin your shirt putting holes in it, but if you put it on your lanyard it is easy. Code of contact -- conduct. We had one for many, many years, and please go read, look it over. I may spend a little bit of time on this, little more than in the past. If there is a situation or something you are concerned about, please report it. Obvious AA bullying, that is pretty clear. -- Obviously bullying, that is pretty clear. But there is also a lot of more nuanced, gray areas that will make someone feel unwelcome or uncomfortable, and certainly if this is happening please communicate that you would like that behavior to stop, and if you feel uncomfortable that could be something as simple as, you know, a bad joke or sort of offensive remark or whatnot. Please don't do that. You might not be aware and may not realize when you're making someone feel uncomfortable. We all make mistakes. It is okay, but if someone lets you know that, please apologize, change your behavior. To let us know about this, not that we are going to throw anyone out right away, but we want to know when things are happening and make sure you feel welcome and included. So that is the code of conduct. Again, if you have questions or concerns, purple shirts! All right, Ruby friends, who is our Ruby friends? That's good, but that's not enough. I need a volunteer to help me with this. All right, so we are going to describe Ruby friends, what it is. 
>> Hi, I'm great! 
>> What is your name? Thomas Marty. 
>> I'm Ernie. Would you like to be my Ruby friend? 
>> I would like to be your Ruby friend! 
>> Then we are going to take a picture, a selfie. 
>> Do you want to put your phone on here? It will slide off. 
>> I'm good with that. 
>> All right. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> So he is going to tweet this. He tweeted with the #RubyFrance. We've been doing this on and off. Make new friends, and tried to -- #RubyFriends. We've been doing this on and off. Make new friends, and tried to introduce yourself to five new this on and off. Make new friends, and tried to introduce yourself to five new  people every day. That's going to be really really easy. If you think that is too easy, stretch it to 15, I don't know, and post your progress to the Internet. That would be great. If you feel comfortable, I can give you some easy icebreakers and things.  Say hey, is this your first RubyConf? What is your favorite session so far? What are you looking forward to doing?  These are all easy things everyone would have an answer for, so there you have it. Okay, lunch. So lunch is in the regency room. It is downstairs, so you found your way here. It is back downstairs. That is where your lunch is. You must have your batch to have food, so please bring your food. -- Badge. You have stickers if you have special dietary restrictions. That is on your bad. -- Badge. Also, we are going to have T-shirts available every day at lunch, so that is where you get your T-shirts. In the past, we waited for the end of the conference. You can get it today, and you can wear it. Again, if you've got questions or concerns please speak up. Let's talk about who we are. For those of you who don't know, we are Ruby Central. We are a nonprofit organization that runs  RubyConf . Also fun fact, we also run the gems infrastructure so when you are on RubyGems infrastructure. That helps pay for all of that, so thank you for  buying a ticket and coming, and thank you to all of our sponsors for their support. 
>> [ Applause ] So Ruby's potential has three directors, we've had many directors over the years -- many directors. Evan Phoenix,  Sarah Mei,  and Marty Haught.  That is our website if you want to go. This event takes a lot of effort, and I am the program chair so I did do part of it with them, but I do not do all the work by myself because that would be insane. And we have a program committee, and these are the lucky, wonderful people who have helped us out with this year's program, so thank you so much. We have Akira Matsuda, Ernie Miller,  Jameson Hampton, Megan Tiu, Sam Phippen,  and Valerie Woolard Srinivasan.  So, thank you. 
>> [ Applause ] 
>> [ Laughter ] so I'm curious, how many of you are here for the first time at RubyConf? That's most of you. That's a lot. Welcome! I'm going to do more before we welcome and  Matz, by the way.  So here are the elements we have in our program. We are going to talk about the keynotes, so keynotes happen here. -- Here in the Biltmore bowl. The keynotes are the bookends of the day, so the start and end of the day, and we also have the post lunch query sessions in here, and they are at -- some fun things we do at Ruby -- rubyconf.org one  -- RubyConf.  This is being recorded by con freak so all the content will be available after the fact, we have live stream and you can see live caption or which is at the bottom of the screen, which is the first time we've done live captioning. So for the live stream, this is the information. You go to the events page. It is kind of funny because you are all here. So, there you have it. That is your information. Yeah, life captioning, so that's only going to be in the Biltmore bowl or crystal ballroom. The URL is available. It is one that we will be tweeting out and ask for if you don't have it. Like magic, there is life captioning -- a live captioning link, so if you want to see the caption on your device, there you go. You use it for that purpose. Thank you. The primary thing you're thinking about when it comes to RubyConf, these are the sessions . You probably seen on our section board. Each program committee member took one theme. You might want to pick one of those and go to all those sessions. They are great, so these are also being recorded by Confreaks yes you will not be able to see all the things you want to do -- see. That is just the nature of the beast. And you could always watch the videos after the fact, so if you miss something no big deal. Talk about birds of a feather. These are during lunch, or they are in the lunch room, and they are Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. They are open discussion groups where you can pick a topic, you will sorta block off part of the time on our board near the registration. If you want to talk about J Ruby or TB or something, it is whatever topic interests you and others, and you can sign up for a spot, and you will meet at the table in the lunchroom at the assigned time, and have the greatest -- great -- discussion, so look at the board as people fill it out. If you have ideas and you're talking to some of the people here and you want to have a broader conversation with other attendees, this is a great opportunity for that, so please take advantage of that. All right, lightning talks. Lightning talks, they are on Wednesday afternoon. They are five minutes or shorter presentations that you do on any topic of interest to you with some limitations. There is a sign-up board that will be made available tomorrow morning and registration, and they go fast so if you really want to give a lightning talk you will want to not delay on that, and we don't -- we never have time for all of them so there is only so much time we have live -- Allied for it and there is so much interest. -- Assigned for it, and there is so much interest. And finally, we are going to talk about the hallway track. It is not an actual track. It is the hallway track, and that's actually the thing I like the most. This is sort of informal conversation that people are having out on the hallways between sessions, and if you're not being part of this you really should. This is of course part of your Ruby challenge where you are chatting and meeting new people. There's a lot of great folks here, and you should take advantage of having these conversations. Networking. All right, again the sponsors. We have so many sponsors this year. So appreciative of all these sponsors that have come to support the conference. I think this is the most sponsors we never had in memory. First of all is diamond level sponsors, it is vastly and Weedmaps. We have Heroku, Cheka, LiveRamp, Engine Yard, and NationBuilder. For gold sponsors, we have Cyndx, Datadog, Braintree, square, Coupa, Cookpad and Twilio. Silver sponsors we have Opendoor and Rootstrap. For bronze sponsors we have mowed, fair, and CodigoDelSur. We also have other sponsors that sponsored various other things like strip sponsored childcare, and ActBlue I believe sponsored travel for scholars is memory is correct. They also have other things they sponsor at the conference, so thank you so much. 
>> [ Applause ] And finally parties. So we have a party states that you can see what, what is going on after the event. Tonight at 5:45, NationBuilder's is hosting a party. It is in the Biltmore. There will be people, a NationBuilder staff that will direct you to a space, and so certainly after the keynote tonight look for that. I do know that with the event, they would like you to RSVP to know how many people to expect, but if you have a bad you can just get in. That is what I understand. Questions, concerns? See where to find us, and we can answer any questions you might have. And with that, we will have Matz up.  
>> [ Applause ] Okay. [ Laughter ] I don't know why. Probably because this is a very great venue. This was the city I was in -- I saw over and over in the Hollywood movies. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> And well, when I speak in English I feel like I am 30% less intelligent. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> You don't understand because you don't speak Japanese, right? In the year 1993, I started developing Ruby. [ Indiscernible ] I had no ambition. [ Laughter ] to take over the world or anything. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> Or I did not try to make any money out of it. I just created [ Indiscernible ] language for fun because as soon as I started programming, I was interested in programming languages because, you know, back then, you know, programming languages is called basic, which is pretty much basic. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> And then, you know, the basic ability [ Indiscernible ]. The basic language was pretty, you know, limited. And then I did not know any other programming language, so I did not the reason, but I felt so frustrated because of that limitation of the language. And then, I find a book explaining the language, and then I did not have a computer to execute the [ Indiscernible ] because back then those PCs came with the basic interpreter, so we would have to buy an assistant and a compiler to execute, or C compiler. Oh, these compilers cost, I don't know, $2000 or something? So it is too expensive for a high school student. [ Laughter ] 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> So, so I just went through the book, and I learned many things like DOS structure programming and user defining data structure. It is called [ Indiscernible ]. These are the defined functions. Those ideas of pretty much [ Indiscernible ] for me. And then, I -- you know, back then I was pretty much interested in programming, computers, programming languages, and along with child psychology, so I'm interested in how the human mind can be expressed. So programming languages is, you know, is a form of expressing our ideas, right? So that, I think that is one of the reasons I got interested in programming languages, so I read research about the -- at the local bookstore, the library, then I graduated from high school and went to university, majored in business science, and gosh. The university library had tons of books and papers on programming language, so I studied about programming language, and I found out these programming language designs -- designs by intention so that we did not know who invented English, right? Or no Chinese, Japanese, natural language. But every primitive language has its inventor or designer, and these languages are designed by intention so that, for example, the [ Indiscernible ] was designed to be educational programming language, and the C programming language is a language to replace assembly to implement up -- upper writing systems, so those getting language designs by clear intention, by human beings -- programming languages were designed by clear intention, by human beings. It was my teenage dream, so these programming languages are designed by people, so why not me? 
>> [ Applause ] 
>> Yeah, it occurred to my teenage brain, but remember it was, it was the 80s. We did not have Internet. [ Laughter ] 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> There was no way to Google about the implementation for the compiler or anything, so I got the books for my local bookstore. I lived near, next to a bookstore so I went to a bookstore -- the bookstore and took the book compiler and then I read. It was a textured -- textbook for a community -- University class, but it was too difficult for a hay school student. I entered university, majored in -- high school student. I entered university, I entered university, majored in computer science, and from the school, then I worked  as a professional programmer for several years, and then finally I thought I got enough skill to implement my own programming language, and it was 93. But then, for my programming language, one because, you know, [ Indiscernible ]. [ Laughter ] but that programming language for more than two years, and I felt okay, this programming language got realistic and usable. Okay, I -- it is about the time to create it on the Internet. So operation on the Internet, so soon after that I formed the mailing list. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> It used to be we used the mail to communicate among the community because we didn't, we didn't have the World Wide Web. Yeah, actually the World Wide Web was invented in 1990, so there was an Internet, but it is not for, you know, the general public. So I did not use the Internet, so I formed a mailing list, and soon after I formed the mailing list 200 people joined that mailing list. You know, communication was formed by that 200. By this community, many people tried to ask me, report bugs and gave me suggestions on anything, so that is how the community movement had started. Actually, we called it open soft because it is 95. The term open soft was invented in 97 De Beque 98 I mean, 98, so it was older than that, so we called them free software. Right? 
>> [ Laughter ]. 
>> Remember the Y2K thing? 
>> [ Laughter ] Thomas at December 31st, 1999, I got in the mail, the email from the publisher that [ Indiscernible ], and they wanted to publish a book about my programming language, Ruby. I said okay. I wrote the book in Japanese, but it is quite difficult for me to write them or translate it into English so that if someone wrote book so me, for my programming language, it is more than welcome. So I agreed on that date, December 31st, 1999. So we did not have any big team that they. In the year 2000, the book was published, so the team of two called the programmer programmers, they wrote the book. -- Book inexpensively, so it took them eight months to read the whole book. I don't know, 400 pages, and it was a very thick book. And then we had peacocks on the front page, so we called it the peacocks book. First the book was published, and then they sold the 20,000 copies of the first version of the Peacock book. 20,000. It's quite a number. Not that big, considering that back then Ruby is, you know, virtually nobody knows Ruby back then. So that, you know, so 20,000 copies, it's a light number. I estimated that Ruby users back then is 10,000 or something. You know, not everybody who bought the book uses Ruby, I guess. 
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> I guess. [ Laughter ] year 2001, next year,  we had the first RubyConf, this conference,  --. the first one was held in Tampa Florida -- Tampa, Florida. Before that, the attendees was -- okay,
