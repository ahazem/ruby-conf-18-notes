## Who and what we're leaving behind

Bianca Escalante ([@biancacreating](https://twitter.com/biancacreating))

### Intro

Introduced herself, talks about just leaving GitHub and pursuing new career opportunities.

### Notes

Talks about how she kept changing topics regarding the keynote.

The hospital she was born into, less than a mile from the hotel where the conference is held.

Says that the hospital is not there anymore.

She used Google StreetView to see the place where the hospital was. Felt bad about the area turning into a homeless encampment.

Talks about homeless people, and how different their paths could be with someone who work for GitHub.

Explains how she finally picked the topic.

> "There's an inquity issue. This particular idea that people get left behind or left out in the creation of technology, is one we don't spend enough time on."

Exclusion (or leaving behind) impacts our community negatively.

> "So, who and what we're leaving behind?"

Talks about her former job as a Social Impact Manager at Github. How she learned about exclusion, and its negative impacts.

> "Give the times we're in, why are we still okay with leaving people behind?"

Different people makes us uncomfortable.

But sitting with discomfort and overcoming fears is how we grow!

Expands on how a lot of people could still feel unsafe in our tech communities (and yes, even the Ruby community).

Talks about lowering the entry barrier to our community and how it can benefit us.

> "If given the chance, what would those people excluded, build?"

Talks about cool things she learned about Ruby community:

1. The Ruby community was punk rock

Revolutionary, and Ruby being born out of frustration with status quo.

2. The Ruby community valued feelings:

In a world of zeros and ones, it was okay (in fact encouraged) to show emotions and feelings.

3. The Ruby community was friendly:

MINASWAN = Matz is nice and so we are nice.

Talks about shortcomings of the community. Discusses open source culture and raises a couple of questions on whether all open source projects is good.

It is not.

Gives a couple of examples of targeted harrasment in which open source projects were used.

Lists a number of communities and organizations making a difference:
