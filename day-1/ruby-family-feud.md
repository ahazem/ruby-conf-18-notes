### Intro

I came in very late, so I missed half of it. (thanks AT&T!)

### Notes

This was basically a game of family feud where two different groups of popular rubyists were trying to guess name responses to survey questions the RubyConf team has asked attendees about a week or two on Twitter before the conference started. What caught my attention the most as soon as I entered the hall was how they choose exactly the same number of female developers (four) as the male ones. Additionally, each team was divided equally: 2 male developers, 2 female. I think that was a great decision from whoever choose the participants.

In general, it was funny and engaging. I liked it.
