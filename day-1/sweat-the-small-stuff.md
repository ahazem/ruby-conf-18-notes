#### About the speaker (extracted from RubyConf website)

Aaron came to Los Angeles in 2010 as a starry eyed technology enthusiast from the heartland, eager to work at one of these fancy internet startups. Since then, he has worked at multiple such startups, two of which have had successful exits, and has learned a thing or two over the years about building great teams. A long time Ruby developer, he enjoys dabbling in functional programming in Elixir and JavaScript. His collection of mechanical keyboards continues to grow steadily.

#### Notes

Could not write anything down. I felt the room was full-packed and could not find a seat (in later talks, I found that this was a wrong impression on my side, most talks felt like that but there were seats available if you look closely).

Also, my laptop died at that time as well and there was no chargers around, later I found them to be hidden somewhere between the chairs.

In general, I remember having a somewhat bad impression about the talk (I found the drawings to be funny, though, not very helpful). I went in about 10 minutes late because I was talking to a guy I met earlier during the keynote.

The part in which I was able to focus the most was about onboarding. The notes he has on [this](https://icanthascheezburger.com/wordpress/?page_id=222) web page include lots of tips and tricks regarding this. I found we are doing many of them already but one thing I liked specifically was this:

> "Set up 1:1s with other roles so the new hire understands how the greater team collaborates".

#### Q&A

I wasn't paying attention to questions and answers on the first day.
