### Intro

Went in after [day-1/unraveling-the-masculinization-of-technology.md] was finished (more than 20 minutes into the talk), so missed a great part of it.

### Notes

Key takeaways:

  - Use Ruby abstractions
  - Handle errors
  - Improve security/safety
  - Improve performance
  - Provide instrumentation

Use an interface description language to create a client library for APIs for several programming languages and services (like Google does, big and small companies also do that).

Swagger's OpenAPI for example.

Google uses protobufs.

Recap:

  - Why write a client library?
  - What should go in a client library?
  - How to write scalable client libraries?
