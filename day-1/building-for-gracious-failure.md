### About the speaker (extracted from RubyConf website)

James is committed to helping engineering teams become more deliberate in how they build software by developing strong learning cultures, principled engineering practices, and holistic architectural thinking. He has been developing software professionally since 2003 and currently works as a Principal Software Engineer for Nav.

### Intro

Went in a few minutes late, missed the introduction.

### Notes

The talk is divided into several points.

> "1. We can't fix what we can't see."

Visualize errors, not through logs. Make errors visible. First step is visibility.

Instrument your code. Track how many jobs are starting, succeeding or failing.

You'll be able to establish a baseline to measure against, and without visibility, you cannot do that.

Talks about using stuff like NewRelic/Bugsnag and the like.

> "2. Return what we can."

Returning some data is far better than returning no data or some errors.

> "3. Accept what we can."

Accept as much data as you can.

> "4. Trust carefully."

Being dependent on others can make their failure, your failure.

I generally felt this talk was very concise, and to the point. I liked it.
