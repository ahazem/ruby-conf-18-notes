### Intro

Went in about 10 minutes late, missed the introduction.

### Notes

We can't fix what we can't see.

Visualize errors, not through logs. Make errors visible. First step is visibility.

Instrument your code. Track how many jobs are starting, succeeding or failing.

You'll be able to establish baseline to measure against, and without visibility, you cannot do that.

Talks about using stuff like NewRelic/Bugsnag and the like.

Return what we can.

Returning some data is far better than returning no data or some errors.

Accept what we can.

Accept as much data as you can.

Trust carefully.

Depending on others can make their failure, your failure.

Talking about partial acceptance not in the sense of accepting invalid data.
