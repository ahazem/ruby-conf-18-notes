### Intro

Jumps into the talk directly. Shows an illustration showing a duck and a rabbit. Asks who see who.

### Notes

Talk is about perspective.

Starts by talking about communication, relates that to http requests / requests in general.

Uses the illustration to talks about perspectives and not seeing a denied request (like from your colleauges) is not failure, but a start of a dialouge.

Goes through the same example: asking colleagues to add unit tests in every change, how we can turn a denied request to a successful one.

Explains the many paths this dialouge could go, ignoring the happy path and going to the other paths.

Goes through different scenarios one by one, giving bad and good examples of what to do / do not.

Tips:

- Get understanding first: make sure they understand your request.
- Don't procrastinate agreement: you need them to agree, don't wait for that.
- Ask it is worth it?
- Stop, drop (the topic temporarily), and listen.

Goes into the last point into more detail, showing different illustrations on what to do, based on external factors (life or work) and past factors (past conversations).

"Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

Giving tips on how to be a good listener.

Weighs between running away from the topic, and also not listening to your colleagues or care about them.
