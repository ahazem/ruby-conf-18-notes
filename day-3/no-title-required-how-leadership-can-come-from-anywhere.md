### Intro

Goes directly into talk.

### Notes

Asks: "Why do we want to be a leader?"

- Money
- Influence

Talks about leadership: "It's about people, not code".

Gives some background from talking to his manager.

"It's about the how, not just the what."

"Leadership is the continuous practice of positive influence".

Some background about his first job: at Microsoft, then going back to college for Masters degree.

Then a story from his participation in a startup weekend event.

Observations:

- Leadership != title
- (something)
- Someone will see my good work (not really)
- Busy work

Things you could do:

- Don't talk, listen.
- Self-assessment.
- Feedback.
- Dive deep, but not always.

Lost interest for a while.

Mentions non-technical aspects of leadership, talks about them, gives an example of how to structure metrics.

It's a cycle: self-assess -> measure -> dive deep -> feedback.

Moves into mentorship. "Don't ignore physical and mental health".

Talks about the biggest problem doing such stuff: Time.

Managers should empower us, not just delegate to us. We should held our organizations accountable.
