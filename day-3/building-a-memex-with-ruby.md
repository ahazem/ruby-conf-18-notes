Building a Memex (with Ruby!)
Andrew Louis

### About (extracted from RubyConf website)

Andrew is a software developer from Toronto. After learning about the Memex, he asked the dangerous question of “why do we still not have this?” and foolishly decided to start building one himself. Previously, he was the co-founder and CTO of ShopLocket, an ecommerce startup which was acquired in 2014.
