### Notes

Talks about Paris and the Eiffel tower.

Throws in something personal, moves then to the history of building the Eiffel tower.

Lots of history about France.

Moves on to the engineers who built Eiffel tower, and some history about them.

More history.

Now really starting to wonder how he will relate all of the intricate details of the building of the tower to Ruby and leading teams.

Finishes history, gets to the software part.

Displays a word on screen and asks people to do thumps up or down:

"Politics"

Most (all?) people do a thump down.

Shows a graph about different approaches to office politics.

Unfortunately, by nature:

Talks about lessons we can learn about leading teams from Gustave Eiffel and him building the tower:

- Networking (or making friends): make friends from other departments.
- Self-promotion (or story-telling): show what you're working on (not in a braggy way though).

Moves on to other topics: negotiation and cooperation.

Explains.

It's not a zero-sum game.

> In reality, there's almost always a middle ground.

The trick is finding that middle ground.

If you put yourself in this spot as a leader, that you have to shield your team from every bit of organization politics that happen above them, it's all but guaranteed to burn you out.

Proposes being a 🔥🛡 to your team rather than a 💩☂️ (meaning that, you just block enough heat to ensure they're able to do their work).

If your team never gets the opportunity to see organizational politics they'll never learn to build their influence / sell their ideas / or negotiate.

Takeway:

>  Don't run from politics.

Refreshing take. I liked the talk.
