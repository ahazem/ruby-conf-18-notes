### Intro

Introduces himself, talks about him recently joining GitHub and them hiring.

### Notes

Talks about Paris and the Eiffel tower.

Throws in something personal, moves then to the history of building the Eiffel tower.

Lots of history about France.

Moves on to the engineers who built Eiffel tower, and some history about them.

More history.

Now really starting to wonder  how he will relate all of the intricate details of the building of the tower to Ruby and leading teams.

Finishes history, gets to the software part.

Displays a word on screen and asks people to do thumps up or down:

"Politics"

Most (all?) people do a thump down.

Shows a graph with information regarding how this makes building software worst.

However:

> "Every organization is political."

Talks about networking and self-promotion: making friends and telling stories (as a better version of the former).

Make friends from other departments.

Show what you're working on (not in a braggy way).

Negotiation / Cooperation: explains.

Don't be a Jannis.

Proposing the Heat-shield (just block enough heat to ensure they're able to do their work).

Don't run from politics.

Refreshing take. I liked the talk.
