Talks about Paris and the Eiffel tower.

Throws in something personal, moves then to the history of building the Eiffel tower.

Lots of history about France.

Moves on to the engineers who built Eiffel tower, and some history about them.

More history.

Really wondering how he will relate all of the intricate details of the building of the tower to Ruby/Leading and so on.

Finishes history, gets to the software part.

Displays a word on screen and asks people to do thumps up or down:

- Politics: most people down. Shows a graph with information regarding how this makes building software worst.

"Every organization is political."

Talks about networking and self-promotion: making friends and telling stories (as a better version of the former).

Make friends from other departments.
Show what you're working on (not in a braggy way).

Negotiation / Cooperation: explains.

Don't be a Jannis.

Proposing the Heat-shield (just block enough heat to ensure they're to do their work).

Don't run from politics.

Refreshing take.
