Talks about herself.

Tosses a few jokes. Laughter.

### Notes

Introduces fictional developer characters: Jenny and Mike.

Goes into story-telling mode, talking about solving the mystery of ruby's missing method.

Talks about instance objects / class instances.

Keeps discussing how class methods work.

Talks about smalltalk:

> "All languages which have been inspired by Smalltalk included their own concept of meta-class."

Explains the difference between `singleton_class` and a `meta class`

Goes back into story-telling.

Cleverly gives an example of writing a simple DSL to explain the use of `singleton_class`.

Talk ends.

Overall, I thought it was a funny talk and I loved it.
