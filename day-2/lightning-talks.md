## Lightning talks

Multiple speakers

### Notes

Did not attend any (or watch the video, yet), but this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLyV5hOqGQ8) by [@searls](https://twitter.com/searls) (in which he introduces a Ruby style guide with linter and automatic code fixing: https://github.com/testdouble/standard) was particularly interesting.

### Video
