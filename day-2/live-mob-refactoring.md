## Live Mob Refactoring

Team Mob

Moderating: [Betsy Haibel](https://twitter.com/betsythemuffin).<br />
Rest of participants: not sure.<br />
Typing person: [Sam Phippen](https://twitter.com/samphippen), one of RSpec maintainers.

### Intro

Screen shows a text file in Vim talking about using the `Poker Dice` problem in interviews.

Describes the problem as small enough to be explained simply, too big to be "completed" in any reasonable interview scenario, and contains a few interesting twists that make for interesting discussion.

Session starts.

Not scripted, volunteers will help doing mob refactoring live.

Moderator explains mobbing:

> "A really effective tool for getting people on the same page, not necessairly write code and finish tasks."

There are different ways to do mobbing.

Moderator approach:

  - The person typing doesn't contribute anything other than typing.
  - Helpful having someone not typing, not participating, sort of just coordinating (her).

Explains poker dice.

### Notes

Running tests, a set of specs on the screen, participants are trying to see a smaller screen in front of them, they can't. Sam explains the implementation.

Participants working on getting one of the specs to green. They define a new method.

Sam jokes about him being an rspec maintainer and how it took him 5 minutes to understand what's going on. Laughter.

They got the test working, moving on to the next spec example.

They create a new method, consult about the poker dice rules.

Trying different pieces of code, not working yet. Sam gives a hint. Still not able to figure it out, audience offer some help, Sam gives another hint. One of the organizers gives a hint.

Moderator explains that they need to think not in how humans could solve this problem, but how a machine would do so.

They got it to work.

Moves on to the next spec. Lost track at this point.

3 minutes later, still trying, Sam stepping in trying to solve it himself. He says implementation made it harder.

Still figuring it out together with the participants.

Got all tests working, cleaning up the code.

Session finished.
